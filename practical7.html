<h1 id="objectives">Objectives</h1>
<p>The learning objectives for this practical are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Writing R scripts.</li>
<li>How to manipulate dates in data.</li>
<li>How to create and use factor objects.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="setup-and-background">Setup and background</h1>
<p>To do this practical you need an installation of R and RStudio. You
can find the instructions in the <a
href="/setup#r-and-rstudio">setup</a> link on how to install R and
RStudio in your system. For a smooth development of this practical, it
is strongly recommended that you follow and finish the previous <a
href="/seminar4/">seminar 4</a> on how to get started with R and
RStudio.</p>
<p>We will download some COVID19 data to illustrate the use of R and
RStudio. Please follow the next two steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Go to the Catalan Health Departament COVID19 data portal at <a
href="https://dadescovid.cat" class="uri">https://dadescovid.cat</a> and
switch the language to “ENGLISH” using the pull-down menu on the
top-right corner of the page.</li>
<li>Follow the downloads link and on the next page click and download
the file corresponding to the “7 DAY AGGREGATION” for “CATALUNYA”. Make
sure you know exactly where in your filesystem this file has been
downloaded. <strong>Tip:</strong> some browsers automatically download
files into a folder called “Downloads” or under a name corresponding to
the translation of “Downloads” to the default language of your operating
system.</li>
<li>Make a directory in your filesystem, for instance at your
<em>home</em> directory, called <code>practical7</code> and copy in it
the downloaded file.</li>
<li>Since the downloaded file is a ZIP file, uncompress as you did in <a
href="/practical1/">practical 1</a> so that you finally have a file
called <code>catalunya_setmanal.csv</code> in the directory
<code>practical7</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you are using the UPF <a href="https://myapps.upf.edu">myapps</a>
cloud to run RStudio, then you need to either use an internet browser in
<em>myapps</em> to download the data file directly in the
<em>myapps</em> cloud or upload to the <em>myapps</em> cloud the file
that you have downloaded in your own computer.</p>
<h1 id="writing-r-scripts">Writing R scripts</h1>
<p>We may often use an interactive R session to quickly examine data or
make some straightforward calculations. In such an interactive session,
we can also recover previous instructions in the R shell by pressing the
<code>upwards arrow</code> key. However, if we really want to keep track
of the R commands we are using, we should write them in a text file with
filename extension <code>.R</code>, which we shall refer hereafter as an
<em>R script</em>.</p>
<p>There are two main ways to create an R script: (1) opening a new file
with a text editor and saving it with filename that includes the
<code>.R</code> extension, or (2) if we are working with RStudio, then
we click on the <code>File</code> menu and select the options
<code>New File</code> -&gt; <code>R Script</code>. When we do that we
should be getting the RStudio window splitted in four panes, the default
three ones and one additional one for the newly created R script, as
shown in the captured window below.</p>
<p><img src="RStudioNewScript.png" /></p>
<p>Type in the newly created R script (either with a text editor or with
RStudio) the following two lines to read the CSV file downloaded in the
previous section. The first line is a comment. Lines starting with the
<code>#</code> symbol are comments in R.</p>
<pre><code>&gt; ## read COVID19 data
&gt; dat &lt;- read.csv(&quot;catalunya_setmanal.csv&quot;, sep=&quot;;&quot;, stringsAsFactors=TRUE)</code></pre>
<p>Now save the R script in the directory <code>practical7</code> under
the filename <code>covid19analysis.R</code>.</p>
<p>To execute a specific line of an R script in RStudio you should move
the cursor to that line in the pane with the script file and press the
key combination <code>Ctrl+Enter</code>. Alternatively, you can also
copy and paste the line from the script to the R shell, specially if you
are not working with RStudio.</p>
<p>The previous line may produce an error if the current working
directory of R is not pointing to the directory where the file
<code>catalunya_setmanal.csv</code> is; see previous <a
href="/seminar4/">seminar 4</a> if you need to find out how to change
the working directory in R and RStudio. In general, changing the working
directory should be always performed in the R shell and
<strong>NEVER</strong> include the instruction that changes the working
directory in an R script. The reason is because you or somebody else may
want to run that script in a different computer where the directory with
the data may be called differently.</p>
<p>You can examine the first 6 rows of the loaded CSV file with the
<code>head()</code> function as follows:</p>

<p><strong>Exercise</strong>: now add to the script
<code>covid19analysis.R</code> the following two lines to obtain a new
<code>data.frame</code> object called <code>datg</code> that includes
only data from the general population, i.e., excluding data from
geriatric residences. You have to figure out the code that replaces de
questions marks <code>??????</code>.</p>
<pre><code>&gt; mask &lt;- ??????

<p>Once you subset data, it is always convenient to compare the
dimensions of the original and resulting object, using the function
<code>dim()</code>, and think whether the difference in dimensions makes
sense (e.g., subsetting should always lead to a smaller object in some
dimension).</p>

<p>It has two columns with date information (<code>DATA_INI</code> and
<code>DATA_FI</code>), corresponding to the begining and end of the
7-day period of the data of that row, but which are stored as string
character vectors (more specifically as <a
href="https://funcompbio.github.io/lecture6/#25">factors</a>). However,
R provides a way to store dates as such and this has the advantage that
facilitates manipulating them for analysis purposes.</p>
<p>For instance, to transform the two columns containing date data we
should use the function <code>as.Date()</code> as follows:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; startdate &lt;- as.Date(datg$DATA_INI)
&gt; enddate &lt;- as.Date(datg$DATA_FI)</code></pre>
<p>While R displays these objects as vectors of character strings, they
do belong to a different class of objects, the class <em>Date</em>.</p>
<pre><code>&gt; head(startdate)

[1] &quot;2022-07-15&quot; &quot;2022-07-14&quot; &quot;2022-07-13&quot; &quot;2022-07-12&quot; &quot;2022-07-11&quot;

[6] &quot;2022-07-16&quot;

&gt; class(enddate)

[1] &quot;Date&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Having dates stored as <em>Date</em>-class objects facilitates
operations on dates such as calculating time differences:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; head(enddate - startdate + 1)

Time differences in days
[1] 7 7 7 7 7 7</code></pre>
<p>or subsetting data for a period of time. For instance, let’s subset
the data, selecting rows corresponding to data between January and
November from 2020, the year in which the COVID19 pandemic started:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; mask &lt;- startdate &gt;= as.Date(&quot;2020-01-01&quot;) &amp; enddate &lt;= as.Date(&quot;2020-11-30&quot;)
&gt; sum(mask)

[1] 275

&gt; datg20 &lt;- datg[mask, ]
&gt; dim(datg20)

[1] 275  25</code></pre>
<p>Note that the number of <code>TRUE</code> values in the logical mask
matches the resulting number of rows in the subsetted object
<code>datg20</code>.</p>
<p>Date data also allows one to easily extract the month of each
date:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; startdate &lt;- as.Date(datg20$DATA_INI)
&gt; m &lt;- months(startdate, abbreviate=TRUE)
&gt; head(m)

[1] &quot;Nov&quot; &quot;Nov&quot; &quot;Nov&quot; &quot;Nov&quot; &quot;Nov&quot; &quot;Nov&quot;

&gt; class(m)

[1] &quot;character&quot;</code></pre>
<p>where we have to use the argument <code>abbreviate=TRUE</code> in the
<code>months()</code> function to obtain a vector of equally sized
character strings, which may be useful for visualization purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> The previous vector <code>m</code> may
contain the names of the months in a different language than English
when the regional configuration of your operating system, known as <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locale_%28computer_software%29">locale
configuration</a>, is also different to English. In such a case, it may
be handy to switch at least the regional time configuration to English,
to facilitate following the rest of this practical. To do that, type the
following instruction on the R shell:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; Sys.setlocale(&quot;LC_TIME&quot;, &quot;C&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>and then type again:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; m &lt;- months(startdate, abbreviate=TRUE)</code></pre>
<p>Verify that now the vector <code>m</code> has the month names in
English.</p>
<h1 id="factors">Factors</h1>
<p><a href="https://funcompbio.github.io/lecture6/#25">Factors</a> in R
are a class of objects that serve the purpose of storing what is known
in statistics as a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_variable">categorical
variable</a>, which is a variable that takes values from a limited
number of <em>categories</em>, also known as <em>levels</em>. So factors
are pretty much like vectors of character strings, but with additional
information about what are the different values that may occur on those
vectors.</p>
<p>Not all vectors of character strings are suitable to become factors.
For instance, a vector of character strings corresponding to gene
identifiers tipically should not become a factor in R, because those
identifiers do not represent any kind of <em>category</em> grouping
observations.</p>
<p>Factors are useful, however, in the context of a statistical analysis
and data visualization, involving categorical variables. To create a
factor object we should call the function <code>factor()</code> giving a
vector of character strings as argument. Let’s consider converting the
previous vector <code>m</code> of character strings to a factor.</p>
<pre><code>&gt; mf &lt;- factor(m)
&gt; head(mf)

[1] Nov Nov Nov Nov Nov Nov
Levels: Apr Aug Feb Jul Jun Mar May Nov Oct Sep</code></pre>
<p>We can see that R displays factors differently to character strings,
by showing the values without double quotes (<code>"</code>) and
providing additional information about the possible <em>levels</em> of
that factor. We can access the level information from a factor object
with the functions <code>levels()</code> and <code>nlevels()</code>.</p>
<pre><code>&gt; levels(mf)

 [1] &quot;Apr&quot; &quot;Aug&quot; &quot;Feb&quot; &quot;Jul&quot; &quot;Jun&quot; &quot;Mar&quot; &quot;May&quot; &quot;Nov&quot; &quot;Oct&quot; &quot;Sep&quot;

&gt; nlevels(mf)

[1] 10</code></pre>
<p>Sometimes, we may want the levels of a factor to comprise a set of
specific values or to be ordered in a specific way. This could be the
case of the previous factor <code>mf</code>, where we would like for
instance to have the levels corresponding to the months of the year and
chronologically ordered. We can do that as follows:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; mf &lt;- factor(m, levels=c(&quot;Jan&quot;, &quot;Feb&quot;, &quot;Mar&quot;, &quot;Apr&quot;, &quot;May&quot;, &quot;Jun&quot;,
+                          &quot;Jul&quot;, &quot;Aug&quot;, &quot;Sep&quot;, &quot;Oct&quot;, &quot;Nov&quot;, &quot;Dec&quot;))
&gt; head(mf)

[1] Nov Nov Nov Nov Nov Nov
Levels: Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec

&gt; levels(mf)

 [1] &quot;Jan&quot; &quot;Feb&quot; &quot;Mar&quot; &quot;Apr&quot; &quot;May&quot; &quot;Jun&quot; &quot;Jul&quot; &quot;Aug&quot; &quot;Sep&quot; &quot;Oct&quot; &quot;Nov&quot; &quot;Dec&quot;

&gt; nlevels(mf)

[1] 12</code></pre>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> The previous call to the
<code>factor()</code> function will <strong>only work</strong> if your
regional time configuration is English. If you are working with a
non-English regional time configuration, you should change the level
names in the argument <code>levels</code> to the language that you are
using.</p>
<p>Now, we can build a contingency table of the level occurrences of a
factor using the function <code>table()</code>.</p>
<pre><code>&gt; table(mf)

mf
Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec

<p>We can see, there is no data in 2020 for the months of January
(because data was not yet recorded) and December (because it is outside
the period we have subsetted the data). We can remove levels of a factor
for which there is no data with the function
<code>droplevels()</code>.</p>
<pre><code>&gt; mf &lt;- droplevels(mf)
&gt; levels(mf)

 [1] &quot;Feb&quot; &quot;Mar&quot; &quot;Apr&quot; &quot;May&quot; &quot;Jun&quot; &quot;Jul&quot; &quot;Aug&quot; &quot;Sep&quot; &quot;Oct&quot; &quot;Nov&quot;

<p>Using this factor we can easily visualize the distribution of the
column <code>R0_CONFIRMAT_M</code> (<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_reproduction_number">R0 basic
reproduction number</a>) as function of the month, calling plot with the
formula notation <code>x ~ y</code> (add this plotting instruction to
the <code>covid19analysis.R</code> script):</p>
<pre><code>&gt; plot(datg20$R0_CONFIRMAT_M ~ mf)</code></pre>
<p><img src="R0byMonth-1.png" /></p>
<p>where here <code>datg20</code> refers to the subset of the original
<code>data.frame</code> object <code>dat</code>, excluding data from
geriatric residences and including only data between January and
November 2020, and <code>mf</code> refers to the factor object with the
months from that subset of data. The resulting plot contains so-called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_plot">box plots</a> for each
month, which allow to visualize the location of the data in terms of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartile">quartiles</a>.</p>
<p>We can see that February has no data points for the column
<code>R0_CONFIRMAT_M</code> despite there are data rows for that month.
To find out why we do not see any data on the plot we can inspect the
values of <code>R0_CONFIRMAT_M</code> for the month of February as
follows:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; mask &lt;- mf == &quot;Feb&quot;
&gt; datg20$R0_CONFIRMAT_M[mask]

[1] NA NA NA NA NA NA</code></pre>
<p>The value <code>NA</code> in R means <em>not available</em> and R
treats it in a special way depending on the operation that is
performing. In the case of plots, <code>NA</code> values are
ignored.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise:</strong> look up in the help page of the
<code>plot()</code> function, how can you change the labels for the
<code>x</code> and <code>y</code> axes to a readable label whose meaning
stands alone and minimally describes the data visualized in that axis.
The resulting plot should be identical to the one above, but with the
axes labels changed.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise:</strong> produce the same kind of plot, but this
time showing in the <em>y</em>-axis the values of the column
<code>IEPG_CONFIRMAT</code>, corresponding to the <a
href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0243701">effective potential
growth</a> also known as risk of outbreak. Can you identify the month in
which this risk has increased the most?</p>
<pre><code>&gt; ## plot risk of outbreak as function of the month
&gt; plot(datg20$IEPG_CONFIRMAT ~ mf, xlab=&quot;Month&quot;, ylab=&quot;Risk of outbreak&quot;)</code></pre>
