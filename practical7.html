<h1 id="objectives">Objectives</h1>
<p>The learning objectives for this practical are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Writing R scripts.</li>
<li>How to manipulate dates in data.</li>
<li>How to create and use factor objects.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="setup-and-background">Setup and background</h1>
<p>To do this practical you need an installation of R and RStudio. You can find the instructions in the <a href="/setup#r-and-rstudio">setup</a> link on how to install R and RStudio in your system. For a smooth development of this practical, it is strongly recommended that you follow and finish the previous <a href="/seminar4/">seminar 4</a> on how to get started with R and RStudio.</p>
<p>We will download some COVID19 data to illustrate the use of R and RStudio. Please follow the next two steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Go to the Catalan Health Departament COVID19 data portal at <a href="https://dadescovid.cat" class="uri">https://dadescovid.cat</a> and switch the language to “ENGLISH” using the pull-down menu on the top-right corner of the page.</li>
<li>Follow the downloads link and on the next page click and download the file corresponding to the “7 DAY AGGREGATION” for “CATALUNYA”. Make sure you know exactly where in your filesystem this file has been downloaded. <strong>Tip:</strong> some browsers automatically download files into a folder called “Downloads” or under a name corresponding to the translation of “Downloads” to the default language of your operating system.</li>
<li>Make a directory in your filesystem, for instance at your <em>home</em> directory, called <code>practical7</code> and copy in it the downloaded file.</li>
<li>Since the downloaded file is a ZIP file, uncompress as you did in <a href="/practical1/">practical 1</a> so that you finally have a file called <code>catalunya_setmanal.csv</code> in the directory <code>practical7</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you are using the UPF <a href="https://myapps.upf.edu">myapps</a> cloud to run RStudio, then you need to either use an internet browser in <em>myapps</em> to download the data file directly in the <em>myapps</em> cloud or upload to the <em>myapps</em> cloud the file that you have downloaded in your own computer.</p>
<h1 id="writing-r-scripts">Writing R scripts</h1>
<p>We may often use an interactive R session to quickly examine data or make some straightforward calculations. In such an interactive session, we can also recover previous instructions in the R shell by pressing the <code>upwards arrow</code> key. However, if we really want to keep track of the R commands we are using, we should write them in a text file with filename extension <code>.R</code>, which we shall refer hereafter as an <em>R script</em>.</p>
<p>There are two main ways to create an R script: (1) opening a new file with a text editor and saving it with filename that includes the <code>.R</code> extension, or (2) if we are working with RStudio, then we click on the <code>File</code> menu and select the options <code>New File</code> -&gt; <code>R Script</code>. When we do that we should be getting the RStudio window splitted in four panes, the default three ones and one additional one for the newly created R script, as shown in the captured window below.</p>
<p><img src="RStudioNewScript.png" /></p>
<p>Type in the newly created R script (either with a text editor or with RStudio) the following two lines to read the CSV file downloaded in the previous section. The first line is a comment. Lines starting with the <code>#</code> symbol are comments in R.</p>
<pre><code>&gt; ## read COVID19 data
&gt; dat &lt;- read.csv(&quot;catalunya_setmanal.csv&quot;, sep=&quot;;&quot;, stringsAsFactors=TRUE)</code></pre>
<p>Now save the R script in the directory <code>practical7</code> under the filename <code>covid19analysis.R</code>.</p>
<p>To execute a specific line of an R script in RStudio you should move the cursor to that line in the pane with the script file and press the key combination <code>Ctrl+Enter</code>. Alternatively, you can also copy and paste the line from the script to the R shell, specially if you are not working with RStudio.</p>
<p>The previous line may produce an error if the current working directory of R is not pointing to the directory where the file <code>catalunya_setmanal.csv</code> is; see previous <a href="/seminar4/">seminar 4</a> if you need to find out how to change the working directory in R and RStudio. In general, changing the working directory should be always performed in the R shell and <strong>NEVER</strong> include the instruction that changes the working directory in an R script. The reason is because you or somebody else may want to run that script in a different computer where the directory with the data may be called differently.</p>
<p>Add to the script <code>covid19analysis.R</code> the necessary code to obtain a new <code>data.frame</code> object including only data from the general population, i.e., excluding data from geriatric residences.</p>

<p>It has two columns with date information (<code>DATA_INI</code> and <code>DATA_FI</code>), but which are stored as string characters (more specifically <em>factors</em>). However, R provides a way to store dates as such and this has the advantage that facilitates manipulating them for analysis purposes.</p>
<p>For instance, to transform the two columns containing date data we should use the function <code>as.Date()</code> as follows:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; startdate &lt;- as.Date(dat$DATA_INI)
&gt; enddate &lt;- as.Date(dat$DATA_FI)</code></pre>
<p>While R displays these objects as vectors of character strings, they do belong to a different class of objects, the class <em>Date</em>.</p>
<pre><code>&gt; head(startdate)

[1] &quot;2020-11-02&quot; &quot;2020-11-02&quot; &quot;2020-11-02&quot; &quot;2020-11-01&quot; &quot;2020-11-01&quot;

[6] &quot;2020-11-07&quot;

&gt; class(enddate)

[1] &quot;Date&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Having dates stored as <em>Date</em>-class objects facilitates operations on dates such as calculating time differences:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; head(enddate - startdate + 1)

Time differences in days
[1] 7 7 7 7 7 7</code></pre>
<p>or extracting the month of each date:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; m &lt;- months(startdate, abbreviate=TRUE)
&gt; head(m)

[1] &quot;Nov&quot; &quot;Nov&quot; &quot;Nov&quot; &quot;Nov&quot; &quot;Nov&quot; &quot;Nov&quot;

&gt; class(m)

[1] &quot;character&quot;</code></pre>
<p>where we have to use the argument <code>abbreviate=TRUE</code> in the <code>months()</code> function to obtain a vector of equally sized character strings, which may be useful for visualization purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> The previous vector <code>m</code> may contain the names of the months in a different language than English when the regional configuration of your operating system, known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locale_%28computer_software%29">locale configuration</a>, is also different to English. In such a case, it may be handy to switch at least the regional time configuration to English, to facilitate following the rest of this practical. To do that, type the following instruction on the R shell:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; Sys.setlocale(&quot;LC_TIME&quot;, &quot;C&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>and then type again:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; m &lt;- months(startdate, abbreviate=TRUE)</code></pre>
<p>Verify that now the vector <code>m</code> has the month names in English.</p>
<h1 id="factors">Factors</h1>
<p>Factors in R are a class of objects that serve the purpose of storing what is known in statistics as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_variable">categorical variable</a>, which is a variable that takes values from a limited number of <em>categories</em>, also known as <em>levels</em>. So factors are pretty much like vectors of character strings, but with additional information about what are the different values that may occur on those vectors.</p>
<p>Not all vectors of character strings are suitable to become factors. For instance, a vector of character strings corresponding to gene identifiers tipically should not become a factor in R, because those identifiers do not represent any kind of <em>category</em> grouping observations.</p>
<p>Factors are useful, however, in the context of a statistical analysis and data visualization, involving categorical variables. To create a factor object we should call the function <code>factor()</code> giving a vector of character strings as argument. Let’s consider converting the previous vector <code>m</code> of character strings to a factor.</p>
<pre><code>&gt; mf &lt;- factor(m)
&gt; head(mf)

[1] Nov Nov Nov Nov Nov Nov
Levels: Apr Aug Feb Jul Jun Mar May Nov Oct Sep</code></pre>
<p>We can see that R displays factors differently to character strings, by showing the values without double quotes (<code>"</code>) and providing additional information about the possible <em>levels</em> of that factor. We can access the level information from a factor object with the functions <code>levels()</code> and <code>nlevels()</code>.</p>
<pre><code>&gt; levels(mf)

 [1] &quot;Apr&quot; &quot;Aug&quot; &quot;Feb&quot; &quot;Jul&quot; &quot;Jun&quot; &quot;Mar&quot; &quot;May&quot; &quot;Nov&quot; &quot;Oct&quot; &quot;Sep&quot;

&gt; nlevels(mf)

[1] 10</code></pre>
<p>Sometimes, we may want the levels of a factor to comprise a set of specific values or to be ordered in a specific way. This could be the case of the previous factor <code>mf</code>, where we would like for instance to have the levels corresponding to the months of the year. We can do that as follows:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; mf &lt;- factor(m, levels=c(&quot;Jan&quot;, &quot;Feb&quot;, &quot;Mar&quot;, &quot;Apr&quot;, &quot;May&quot;, &quot;Jun&quot;,
+                          &quot;Jul&quot;, &quot;Aug&quot;, &quot;Sep&quot;, &quot;Oct&quot;, &quot;Nov&quot;, &quot;Dec&quot;))
&gt; head(mf)

[1] Nov Nov Nov Nov Nov Nov
Levels: Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec

&gt; levels(mf)

 [1] &quot;Jan&quot; &quot;Feb&quot; &quot;Mar&quot; &quot;Apr&quot; &quot;May&quot; &quot;Jun&quot; &quot;Jul&quot; &quot;Aug&quot; &quot;Sep&quot; &quot;Oct&quot; &quot;Nov&quot; &quot;Dec&quot;

&gt; nlevels(mf)

[1] 12</code></pre>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> The previous call to the <code>factor()</code> function will <strong>only work</strong> if your regional time configuration is English. If you are working with a non-English regional time configuration, you should change the level names in the argument <code>levels</code> to the language that you are using.</p>
<p>Now, we can build a contingency table of the level occurrences of a factor using the function <code>table()</code>.</p>
<pre><code>&gt; table(mf)

<p>We can see, there is no data in 2020 for the months of January (because data was not yet recorded) and December (because it was November at the time of elaborating this practical). We can remove levels of a factor for which there is no data with the function <code>droplevels()</code>.</p>
<pre><code>&gt; mf &lt;- droplevels(mf)
&gt; levels(mf)

 [1] &quot;Feb&quot; &quot;Mar&quot; &quot;Apr&quot; &quot;May&quot; &quot;Jun&quot; &quot;Jul&quot; &quot;Aug&quot; &quot;Sep&quot; &quot;Oct&quot; &quot;Nov&quot;

<p>Add the necessary lines of code to the script <code>covid19analysis.R</code> to create a factor object with the months in which each data row was recorded in the general population, i.e., excluding data from geriatric residences. Using this factor we can easily visualize the distribution of the columns <code>R0_CONFIRMAT_M</code> (R0 basic reproduction number) and <code>IEPG_CONFIRMAT</code> (risk of outbreak) in the general population, as function of the month, calling plot with the formula notation <code>x ~ y</code>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; plot(datg$R0_CONFIRMAT_M ~ mf)</code></pre>
<p><img src="R0byMonth-1.png" /> where here <code>datg</code> refers to the subset of the original <code>data.frame</code> object <code>dat</code>, excluding data from geriatric residences, and <code>mf</code> refers to the factor object with the months from that subset of data. The resulting plot contains so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_plot">box plots</a> for each month, which allow to visualize the location of the data in terms of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartile">quartiles</a>.</p>
<p>Once you have obtained the plot, look up in the help page of the <code>plot()</code> function, how can you change the labels for the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> axes to a more readable label. The resulting plot should be similar to the one above</p>
<p>We can see that February has no data points for the column <code>R0_CONFIRMAT_M</code> despite there are data rows for that month. To find out why we do not see any data on the plot we can inspect the values of <code>R0_CONFIRMAT_M</code> for the month of February as follows:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; datg$R0_CONFIRMAT_M[mf == &quot;Feb&quot;]

[1] NA NA NA NA NA NA</code></pre>
<p>The value <code>NA</code> in R means <em>not available</em> and R treats it in a special way depending on the operation that is performing. In the case of plots, <code>NA</code> values are ignored.</p>
<p>Plot now the risk of outbreak as function of the month, can you identify the month in which this risk has increased the most? Add the two plotting instructions to the <code>covid19analysis.R</code> script.</p>
<pre><code>&gt; ## plot risk of outbreak as function of the month
&gt; plot(datg$IEPG_CONFIRMAT ~ mf, xlab=&quot;Month&quot;, ylab=&quot;Risk of outbreak&quot;)</code></pre>
