<h1 id="objectives">Objectives</h1>
<p>The learning objectives for this practical are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Writing R scripts.</li>
<li>How to manipulate dates in data.</li>
<li>How to create and use factor objects.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="setup-and-background">Setup and background</h1>
<p>To do this practical you need an installation of R and RStudio. You
can find the instructions in the <a
href="/setup#r-and-rstudio">setup</a> link on how to install R and
RStudio in your system. For a smooth development of this practical, it
is strongly recommended that you follow and finish the previous <a
href="/seminar4/">seminar 4</a> on how to get started with R and
RStudio.</p>
<p>We will use the data files called
<code>mostres_analitzades.csv</code> and
<code>virus_detectats.csv</code> that were generated in the <a
href="/practical1/">first practical</a>. If you don’t have these files,
please review that practical and generate them again. Once you have
obtained those two files, copy them into a fresh new directory called
<code>practical7</code>. The values obtained below have been obtained
with the following specific versions (Feb 9, 2026) of these files:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="mostres_analitzades.csv">mostres_analitzades.csv</a>.</li>
<li><a href="virus_detectats.csv">virus_detectats.csv</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="writing-r-scripts">Writing R scripts</h1>
<p>We may often use an interactive R session to quickly examine data or
make some straightforward calculations. In such an interactive session,
we can also recover previous instructions in the R shell by pressing the
<code>upwards arrow</code> key. However, if we really want to keep track
of the R commands we are using, we should write them in a text file with
filename extension <code>.R</code>, which we shall refer hereafter as an
<em>R script</em>.</p>
<p>There are two main ways to create an R script: (1) opening a new file
with a text editor and saving it with filename that includes the
<code>.R</code> extension, or (2) if we are working with RStudio, then
we click on the <code>File</code> menu and select the options
<code>New File</code> -&gt; <code>R Script</code>. When we do that we
should be getting the RStudio window splitted in four panes, the default
three ones and one additional one for the newly created R script, as
shown in the captured window below.</p>
<p><img src="RStudioNewScript.png" /></p>
<p>Type in the newly created R script (either with a text editor or with
RStudio) the following two lines to read the CSV file downloaded in the
previous section. The first line is a comment. Lines starting with the
<code>#</code> symbol are comments in R.</p>
<pre><code>&gt; ## read SIVIC data
&gt; dat &lt;- read.csv(&quot;mostres_analitzades.csv&quot;, stringsAsFactors=TRUE)</code></pre>
<p>Now save the R script in the directory <code>practical7</code> under
the filename <code>sivicanalysis.R</code>.</p>
<p>To execute a specific line of an R script in RStudio you should move
the cursor to that line in the pane with the script file and press the
key combination <code>Ctrl+Enter</code> (<code>Cmd+Enter</code> in Apple
computers). Alternatively, you can also copy and paste the line from the
script to the R shell, specially if you are not working with
RStudio.</p>
<p>The previous line may produce an error if the current working
directory of R is not pointing to the directory where the file
<code>.csv</code> is; see previous <a href="/seminar4/">seminar 4</a> if
you need to find out how to change the working directory in R and
RStudio.</p>
<p>In general, changing the working directory should be always performed
in the R shell and <strong>NEVER</strong> include the instruction that
changes the working directory in an R script. The reason is because you
or somebody else may want to run that script in a different computer
where the directory with the data may be called differently.</p>
<p>You can examine the first 6 rows of the loaded CSV file with the
<code>head()</code> function as follows:</p>

<p><strong>Exercise</strong>: tabulate the values of the column
<code>sexe</code> with the function <code>table()</code>. Add to the
script <code>sivicanalysis.R</code> the following two lines to obtain a
new <code>data.frame</code> object called <code>dat2</code> that
excludes rows where the value in the column <code>sexe</code> is
<code>No disponible</code>. You have to figure out the code that
replaces the questions marks <code>??????</code> below.</p>
<pre><code>&gt; mask &lt;- ??????
+ dat2 &lt;- dat[mask, ]</code></pre>
<p>Once you subset data, it is always convenient to compare the
dimensions of the original and resulting object, using the function
<code>dim()</code>, and think whether the difference in dimensions makes
sense (e.g., subsetting should always lead to a smaller object in some
dimension), and whether the number of rows in this case matches the
number of <code>TRUE</code> values in the logical mask.</p>
<h1 id="date-data-management">Date-data management</h1>
<p>These data have two columns called <code>data_inici</code> and
<code>data_final</code> that corresponding to the begining and end of
the 7-day period of the data of that row, but which are stored as string
character vectors (more specifically as <a
href="https://funcompbio.github.io/lecture6/#26">factors</a>). However,
R provides a way to store dates as such and this has the advantage that
facilitates manipulating them for analysis purposes.</p>
<p>For instance, to transform the two columns containing date data we
should use the function <code>as.Date()</code> as follows:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; startdate &lt;- as.Date(dat2$data_inici, &quot;%d/%m/%Y&quot;)
&gt; enddate &lt;- as.Date(dat2$data_final, &quot;%d/%m/%Y&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Here the second argument informs the function <code>as.Date()</code>
about the format of the input dates, in this case,
<em>day/month/4-digit-year</em> corresponding to the format string
<code>"%d/%m/%Y</code>. The help page of <code>as.Date()</code> contains
full details about this. While R displays these objects as vectors of
character strings in the format <em>4-digit-year-month-day</em>, they do
belong to a different class of objects, the class <em>Date</em>.</p>
<pre><code>&gt; head(startdate)

&gt; class(enddate)

[1] &quot;Date&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Having dates stored as <em>Date</em>-class objects facilitates
operations on dates such as calculating time differences:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Calculating time differences:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; head(enddate - startdate + 1)

Time differences in days
[1] 7 7 7 7 7 7</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Caculating earliest and latest time with the <code>min()</code>
and <code>max()</code> functions:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; min(startdate)

[1] &quot;2022-05-09&quot;

&gt; max(startdate)

[1] &quot;2026-01-26&quot;</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Subsetting data for a period of time. For instance, let’s subset
the data, selecting rows corresponding to the last academic year from
September 2023 to June 2024:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; mask &lt;- startdate &gt;= as.Date(&quot;2023-09-01&quot;) &amp; enddate &lt;= as.Date(&quot;2024-06-30&quot;)
&gt; sum(mask)

[1] 8079

&gt; dat2yr2324 &lt;- dat2[mask, ]
&gt; dim(dat2yr2324)

[1] 8079   13</code></pre>
<p>Note that the number of <code>TRUE</code> values in the logical mask
matches the resulting number of rows in the subsetted object
<code>dat2yr2324</code>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Date data also allows one to easily extract the month of each date.
Let’s extract again the starting date this time for the subsetted data,
and see how do we get the months from those dates:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; startdate &lt;- as.Date(dat2yr2324$data_inici, &quot;%d/%m/%Y&quot;)
&gt; m &lt;- months(startdate, abbreviate=TRUE)
&gt; head(m)

[1] &quot;Oct&quot; &quot;Sep&quot; &quot;Oct&quot; &quot;Sep&quot; &quot;Oct&quot; &quot;Oct&quot;

&gt; class(m)

[1] &quot;character&quot;</code></pre>
<p>where we have to use the argument <code>abbreviate=TRUE</code> in the
<code>months()</code> function to obtain a vector of equally sized
character strings, which may be useful for visualization purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> The previous vector <code>m</code> may
contain the names of the months in a different language than English
when the regional configuration of your operating system, known as <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locale_%28computer_software%29">locale
configuration</a>, is also different to English. In such a case, it may
be handy to switch at least the regional time configuration to English,
to facilitate following the rest of this practical. To do that, type the
following instruction on the R shell:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; Sys.setlocale(&quot;LC_TIME&quot;, &quot;C&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>and then type again:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; m &lt;- months(startdate, abbreviate=TRUE)</code></pre>
<p>Verify that now the vector <code>m</code> has the month names in
English.</p>
<h1 id="factors">Factors</h1>
<p><a href="https://funcompbio.github.io/lecture6/#26">Factors</a> in R
are a class of objects that serve the purpose of storing what is known
in statistics as a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_variable">categorical
variable</a>, which is a variable that takes values from a limited
number of <em>categories</em>, also known as <em>levels</em>. So factors
are pretty much like vectors of character strings, but with additional
information about what are the different values that may occur on those
vectors.</p>
<p>Not all vectors of character strings are suitable to become factors.
For instance, a vector of character strings corresponding to gene
identifiers tipically should not become a factor in R, because those
identifiers do not represent any kind of <em>category</em> grouping
observations.</p>
<p>Factors are useful, however, in the context of a statistical analysis
and data visualization, involving categorical variables. To create a
factor object we should call the function <code>factor()</code> giving a
vector of character strings as argument. Let’s consider converting the
previous vector <code>m</code> of character strings to a factor.</p>
<pre><code>&gt; mf &lt;- factor(m)
&gt; head(mf)

[1] Oct Sep Oct Sep Oct Oct
Levels: Apr Dec Feb Jan Jun Mar May Nov Oct Sep</code></pre>
<p>We can see that R displays factors differently to character strings,
by showing the values without double quotes (<code>"</code>) and
providing additional information about the possible <em>levels</em> of
that factor. We can access the level information from a factor object
with the functions <code>levels()</code> and <code>nlevels()</code>.</p>
<pre><code>&gt; levels(mf)

 [1] &quot;Apr&quot; &quot;Dec&quot; &quot;Feb&quot; &quot;Jan&quot; &quot;Jun&quot; &quot;Mar&quot; &quot;May&quot; &quot;Nov&quot; &quot;Oct&quot; &quot;Sep&quot;

&gt; nlevels(mf)

[1] 10</code></pre>
<p>Note that we have 10 levels instead of 12, because the subsetted data
includes only the months corresponding to the academic year, i.e., from
September to June.</p>
<p>Sometimes, we may want the levels of a factor to comprise a set of
specific values or to be ordered in a specific way. This could be the
case of the previous factor <code>mf</code>, where we would like for
instance to have the levels corresponding to the months of the year and
chronologically ordered. We can do that as follows:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; mf &lt;- factor(m, levels=c(&quot;Jan&quot;, &quot;Feb&quot;, &quot;Mar&quot;, &quot;Apr&quot;, &quot;May&quot;, &quot;Jun&quot;,
+                          &quot;Jul&quot;, &quot;Aug&quot;, &quot;Sep&quot;, &quot;Oct&quot;, &quot;Nov&quot;, &quot;Dec&quot;))
&gt; head(mf)

[1] Oct Sep Oct Sep Oct Oct
Levels: Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec

&gt; levels(mf)

 [1] &quot;Jan&quot; &quot;Feb&quot; &quot;Mar&quot; &quot;Apr&quot; &quot;May&quot; &quot;Jun&quot; &quot;Jul&quot; &quot;Aug&quot; &quot;Sep&quot; &quot;Oct&quot; &quot;Nov&quot; &quot;Dec&quot;

&gt; nlevels(mf)

[1] 12</code></pre>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> The previous call to the
<code>factor()</code> function will <strong>only work</strong> if your
regional time configuration is English. If you are working with a
non-English regional time configuration, you should change the level
names in the argument <code>levels</code> to the language that you are
using.</p>
<p>Now, we can build a contingency table of the level occurrences of a
factor using the function <code>table()</code>.</p>
<pre><code>&gt; table(mf)

mf
 Jan  Feb  Mar  Apr  May  Jun  Jul  Aug  Sep  Oct  Nov  Dec 
1012  860  872  905  739  672    0    0  648  980  812  579 </code></pre>
<p>We can see, there is no data for the months of July and August. We
can remove levels of a factor for which there is no data with the
function <code>droplevels()</code>.</p>
<pre><code>&gt; mf &lt;- droplevels(mf)
&gt; levels(mf)

 [1] &quot;Jan&quot; &quot;Feb&quot; &quot;Mar&quot; &quot;Apr&quot; &quot;May&quot; &quot;Jun&quot; &quot;Sep&quot; &quot;Oct&quot; &quot;Nov&quot; &quot;Dec&quot;

1012  860  872  905  739  672  648  980  812  579 </code></pre>
<p>One of the common uses of a factor is to aggregate numerical values
by the levels of that factor. For instance, in our previous data, the
column <code>positiu</code> contains the number of positively tested
individuals, but each value in that column corresponds to the number per
week, region, sex, age group and socioeconomical index. Let’s say we
want to aggregate those positively tested individuals per month in the
<code>data.frame</code> object <code>dat2yr2324</code>. We can use the
function <code>aggregate()</code> for that purpose, as follows:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; posbymonth &lt;- aggregate(dat2yr2324$positiu, list(month=mf), sum)</code></pre>
<p>Here the first argument is the vector (column of
<code>dat2yr2324</code> in this case) with numerical values that we want
to aggregate, the second argument is a <code>list</code> object with one
element for each factor whose levels we want to use to group the values,
and the third argument is the function we want to use to summarize the
data per group. The result is a <code>data.frame</code> object with one
column per factor and a final column called <code>x</code> with the
aggregate values:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; posbymonth

   month   x

10   Dec 543</code></pre>
<p>We can visualize these data in a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scatter_plot">scatter plot</a> by
converting the factor into an integer, and plotting the month into the
x-axis and the numerical value into the y-axis:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; plot(as.integer(posbymonth$month), posbymonth$x, type=&quot;b&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="posbymonth-1.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Exercise:</strong> look up in the help page of the
<code>plot()</code> function, how can you change the labels for the
<code>x</code> and <code>y</code> axes to a readable label whose meaning
stands alone and minimally describes the data visualized in that axis.
The resulting plot should be identical to the one above, but with the
axes labels changed.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise:</strong> Repeat the same plot, but instead of
aggregating the number of positive cases, aggregate the positive rate by
first calculating it using the columns <code>total</code> and
<code>positiu</code>, and then using the <code>mean()</code> function to
aggregate the values. Can you interpret the resulting plot?</p>
<!--
dat2yr2324$posRate <- dat2yr2324$positiu / dat2yr2324$total *100
posRateByMonth <- aggregate(dat2yr2324$posRate, list(month=mf), mean)
plot(as.integer(posRateByMonth$month), posRateByMonth$x, type="b")

or, more numerically stable,

pbym <- aggregate(dat2yr2324$positiu, list(month=mf), sum)
tbym <- aggregate(dat2yr2324$total, list(month=mf), sum)
pct <- 100 * pbym$x / tbym$x

use this more numerically stable approach to suggest the plot below
-->
<p><strong>Exercise:</strong> Aggregate again the positive rate as in
the previous exercise, but this time by two factors, month and age group
(look up in the <code>data.frame</code> object <code>dat2yr2324</code>
which column may store the age group). Assuming the result of the
function <code>aggregate()</code> is stored into a
<code>data.frame</code> object called <code>posrbymonthage</code>, plot
the aggregated positive rate as function of the month using the
following plotting instruction:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; plot(posrbymonthage$x ~ posrbymontage$month, xlab=&quot;Month&quot;, ylab=&quot;Positive rate&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>The resulting plot contains so-called <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_plot">box plots</a> for each
month, which allow one to visualize the location and spread of the data
in terms of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartile">quartiles</a>. How would
you interpret the different sizes of the boxes throughout the months of
the year?</p>
<!--
dat2yr2324$month <- month=mf
posrbymonthage <- aggregate(x = dat2yr2324$posRate,by = list(month=mf, edat= dat2yr2324$grup_edat) , mean)
plot(posrbymonthage$x ~ posrbymonthage$month, xlab="Month", ylab="Positive rate")
